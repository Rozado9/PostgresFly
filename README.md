# PostgresFly
A streamlined tool for remotely installing PostgreSQL on Linux machines using a Windows interface. Fly through your setup with PostgresFly!

**PostgresFly** is an efficient tool designed for Windows users to remotely install various versions of PostgreSQL on Linux machines. Following the installation of PostgreSQL, PostgresFly provides a backup script to facilitate regular backups of your PostgreSQL database. With its user-friendly interface, PostgresFly allows for the installation of the desired PostgreSQL version on a Linux server with just a few inputs and a single click.

## Operating System:
- The tool is developed for Windows and facilitates the installation of various PostgreSQL versions on a Linux machine via a remote connection.

# Prerequisites

## User Permissions on the Linux Machine:
- The executing user must have `sudo` permissions.
- In `/etc/sudoers`, the entry `Username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` should be present. Replace "Username" with the actual username.

## Directory Structure on the Linux Machine:
- A `pg-data` directory should be present in the root directory where PostgreSQL data will be stored.
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /pg-data

## Required Software on Linux Machines:
- **SSH** for remote connection:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install openssh-server

- **PowerShell** for backup tasks using the provided script:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https software-properties-common
  source /etc/os-release
  wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$VERSION_ID/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y powershell

## Starting the Application

1. Download and extract the `PostgresFly.zip` file from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the extracted folder.
3. It is recommended to run `PostgresFly.exe` as an administrator to ensure that the program has the necessary permissions. Right-click `PostgresFly.exe` and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.


## User Interface & Functionalities

- **IP/Hostname**: Enter the IP address or DNS name of the Linux machine.
- **Username & User Pass**: Credentials of the user on the Linux machine who will perform the installation.
- **SID-Name**: Name of the PostgreSQL instance.
- **Postgres Pass**: Password for the "postgres" user on the Linux machine. Note: This is not a database user.
- **PostgreSQL-Port**: Default is 5432. If using a different port, enter it in the provided field, otherwise use the default port 5432.
- **PostgreSQL-Version**: Select the desired version from the dropdown list.

## Monitoring Installation Progress

As the installation proceeds, the progress bar in the GUI will indicate the status of the installation. It ranges from 0% (beginning of the installation) to 100% (installation complete). Ensure that you wait for the progress bar to reach 100% before proceeding with other tasks or closing the application.
