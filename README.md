# PostgresFly
A Python-developed tool for remotely installing PostgreSQL on Linux machines via a Windows interface. Fly through your setup with PostgresFly!

**PostgresFly**  is an efficient tool, crafted in Python, designed for Windows users to remotely install various versions of PostgreSQL on Linux machines directly from the source. By installing from source, users not only benefit from customization and performance optimizations but also have the ability to install PostgreSQL extensions that aren't included in the standard PostgreSQL distribution. This offers greater flexibility and expanded functionality for database management. Following the installation, PostgresFly provides a backup script to facilitate regular backups of your PostgreSQL database. With its user-friendly interface, PostgresFly allows for the installation of the desired PostgreSQL version on a Linux server with just a few inputs and a single click.

## Operating System:
- The tool is developed for Windows and facilitates the installation of various PostgreSQL versions on a Linux machine via a remote connection.

# Prerequisites

## User Permissions on the Linux Machine:
- The executing user must have `sudo` permissions.
- In `/etc/sudoers`, the entry `Username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL` should be present. Replace "Username" with the actual username.

## Directory Structure on the Linux Machine:
- A `pg-data` directory should be present in the root directory where PostgreSQL data will be stored.
  ```bash
  sudo mkdir /pg-data

## Required Software on Linux Machines:
- **SSH** for remote connection:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install openssh-server

- **PowerShell** for backup tasks using the provided script:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https software-properties-common
  source /etc/os-release
  wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$VERSION_ID/packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y powershell

## Starting the Application

1. Download and extract the `PostgresFly.zip` file from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the extracted folder.
3. It is recommended to run `PostgresFly.exe` as an administrator to ensure that the program has the necessary permissions. Right-click `PostgresFly.exe` and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.


## User Interface & Functionalities

![PostgresFly Interface](PostgresFly.png)

- **IP/Hostname**: Enter the IP address or DNS name of the Linux machine.
- **Username & User Pass**: Credentials of the user on the Linux machine who will perform the installation.
- **SID-Name**: Name of the PostgreSQL instance.
- **Postgres Pass**: Password for the "postgres" user on the Linux machine. Note: This is not a database user.
- **PostgreSQL-Port**: Default is 5432. If using a different port, enter it in the provided field, otherwise use the default port 5432.
- **PostgreSQL-Version**: Select the desired version from the dropdown list.

### Test Connection
Tests the connection to the Linux machine.

### Install PostgreSQL
Initiates the installation of the selected PostgreSQL version.

### View Logs
Displays the installation logs.

### Exit
Closes the tool.

## Workflow

1. **Enter Information**: Fill in all the required fields.
2. **Select Actions**: For example, "Test Connection" or "Start Installation".
3. **Receive Installation Feedback**: A message box will notify about the success or failure of the action.
4. **Check Logs if Needed**: Useful in case of errors or to monitor the process.

## Monitoring Installation Progress

As the installation proceeds, the progress bar in the GUI will indicate the status of the installation. It ranges from 0% (beginning of the installation) to 100% (installation complete). Ensure that you wait for the progress bar to reach 100% before proceeding with other tasks or closing the application.

## After the Installation
Once the PostgreSQL installation is complete, you'll need to start the specific PostgreSQL instance on the Linux VM. The service name follows the format pg-sidname.service, where "sidname" is the name of the PostgreSQL instance you provided:

 ```bash
sudo systemctl start pg-sidname.service
```
To verify that the specific PostgreSQL instance has started successfully, you can check the service status with the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status pg-sidname.service
```
If the service has started correctly, the status will display as active (running).

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
- Verify the IP, username, and password.
- Ensure that the SSH service is installed on the Linux machine.

### Installation Issues
- Review the logs to diagnose any issues.
- Ensure all prerequisites are met.

### UI Issues
- Restart the program.
